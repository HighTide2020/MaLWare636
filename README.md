# Hello, I'm Nick.

### Professionally I work in technolgy as a .. 
<small><strong>Full-Stack Eningeer</strong></small> 

<small><strong>I believe in a robust, free, and open internet. The internet – as it exists currently – is fragile, centralized, and is vulnerable to (and increasingly captured and subverted by) longstanding societal power structures. I believe a digital dark age is coming and/or here. I believe we will continue down the path of destroying the internet because we need regulation to stop it, and the current state of late-stage capitalism means that politicians are beholden to different class of people than me.</strong></small>

Anyways hit me up..
